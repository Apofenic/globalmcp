# Generic Project Guidelines

## Company References

- **Avoid Company-Specific References**: Do not include references to specific companies (El Toro, etc.) in code, documentation, or configuration files
- **Use Generic Examples**: When examples are needed, use placeholder company names like "YourCompany" or generic terms
- **Environment Variables**: Use generic placeholder format like `${COMPANY_URL}` instead of specific company domains

## Documentation Standards

- **Focus on Technical Content**: Documentation should focus purely on technical implementation and usage
- **Generic Use Cases**: Present use cases that apply broadly rather than company-specific scenarios
- **Universal Standards**: Follow industry-standard practices and patterns without company-specific customizations
